# Stockmarket Forcasting 📊🖥️

## Predicting next close using neural network


Stock market forecasting involves predicting future stock prices or trends using historical data. Neural networks, especially deep learning models, have become popular tools for this task due to their ability to detect complex, non-linear patterns in large datasets.

A common approach is using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or their advanced variant, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, because they are well-suited for time-series data like stock prices. These models can "remember" past information and use it to make predictions about future prices.


While neural networks can enhance forecasting accuracy, they are not foolproof due to the stock market’s inherent volatility and influence from unpredictable external factors.

# Key steps include:

1. **Data Collection** – Gathering historical stock data (e.g., prices, volume, indicators).
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Normalizing data and creating sequences for input.
3. **Model Training** – Feeding the data into the neural network to learn patterns.
4. **Prediction** – Using the trained model to forecast future prices.
